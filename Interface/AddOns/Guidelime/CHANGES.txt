    fixed / improved scan quest script
    
    - guides that were not using "GetAddOnMetadata(addonName, "title")" as group name were not found
    - there were problems when there are multiple paths possible; therefore now one starting point and only one possible next guide is chosen (will get improved later on)
    - error message for accepting more than 20 quests is now only shown for the first time it occurs for each part
