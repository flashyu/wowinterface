Based on https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spinx-gathermate2-data-classic

**Don't forget to remove the `-master` surfix from folder name**

* Fixed Black Lotus nodes in Easten Plaguelands, they were very incorrect (source WoWHead)
* Added missing BL node in Silithus (source WoWHead)
* Added BL node in Silithus (61,31) that doesn't exist in WoWHead, according to old Allakhazam comments, need to verify this
